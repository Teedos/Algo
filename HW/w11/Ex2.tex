\subsection*{h}
$X_i$ indicates that the ith element is a match.\\
Y indicates a match after the $n - k + 1$ element.
\begin{equation*}
    E[X] = E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_{n - k} + Y]
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = 1 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n - k}E[x_i] = 1 + \frac{n - k}{k + 1}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    = \frac{n + 1}{k + 1}
\end{equation*}
with $k = 1$:
\begin{equation*}
    E[X] = \frac{n + 1}{2}
\end{equation*}

The worst case with $k = 1$ is: $n - k + 1 = n$
To all these solutions we need to add the time needed to randomize the input array.
\subsection{i}
The preferred way is to use deterministic-search because it has a better expected running time and it is guaranteed to terminate after n iterations.\\
It takes a linear time to permute the array for the scramble-search. We can use this time to perform a linear search.
