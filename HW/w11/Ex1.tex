X = number of ball tossed until success (two balls in a bin)\\
\begin{equation*}
    E[X] = \sum_{i = 2}^{b + 1}iP(X = i)
\end{equation*}
If we are at step i means that the previous i - 1 tries have failed.\\
\begin{equation*}
    P(X = i) = 1(\frac{b -1 }{b})(\frac{b - 2}{b})...(\frac{b - i + 2}{b})(\frac{i - 1}{b})
\end{equation*}
So we have:
\begin{equation*}
    E[X] = \sum_{i = 2}^{b + 1}i(\frac{b -1 }{b})(\frac{b - 2}{b})...(\frac{b - i + 2}{b})(\frac{i - 1}{b})
\end{equation*}
